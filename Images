<h1>Below are two various images that I have displayed on this page. One is hosted within the github repo, while the other is a source I have found online. This shows that I am able to display images in Markdown</h1>
<h1>Image #1 can be viewed here</h1>
<img src = "Bagel meme.png" alt = "Beach">
<h2>This image is hosted directly in the Github Repo.</h2>
<h1>Image #2 can be viewed here</h1>
<img src = "https://ibb.co/QMVC1Kh" alt = "Space">
<h2>This image is not in the Repo, instead it is hosted on a website.</h2>
